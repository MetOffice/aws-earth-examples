# Met Office on AWS Earth

Some of the most important weather datasets produced by the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us) are now available for free on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com), as part of the [Earth on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/) initiative.

This repo contains example code of how to access these datasets. We also give you instructions on how to request support or contribute.

### Getting Started

 - Data is available on AWS in [S3 buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
 - Each forecast simulation is comprised of many files stored in [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/).
 - You can subscribe to [SNS topics](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to be notified when new data is made available.
 - You can find a list of buckets and topics on the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/uk-met-office/).

We have made [some examples available](https://github.com/MetOffice/aws-earth-examples/tree/master/examples) in the form of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
